        The region of Andhra Pradesh has a significant historical presence dating back to ancient times. The Satavahana dynasty,
         which ruled from the 2nd century BCE to the 3rd century CE, had its capital at Amaravati.
        Buddhism flourished during this period, and the Amaravati Stupa, one of the great stupas of ancient India, was constructed.
